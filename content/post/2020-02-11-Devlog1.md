Week one has covered a few topics of interest, however what primarily interested myself was the aspect of the ethics of archeology and the issues surrounding its undertaking and perpetuation within a historical and regular day to day life context. Due to my earlier work in ancient studies, primarily in the ancient greek sector due to my own descent as a Spartiates, I was aware of the ways in which archeology had essentially taken from the host nations for the benefit of the diggers, primarily in britain. In a historical class context, we rarely cover this issue, for we simply look at collections such as the british museum and its vast collection of artifacts and items from across the mediteranean and old world for their historical value, rather than evaluating why they appear in a British museum rather than a middle eastern, Italian, or Greek equivalent. As historians we are quick to ignore these issues in pursuit of our own topics of interest and study rather than truly evaluating the bad they can accomplish in the world for a perceived preservation of knowledge and history.  In addition to this we have the issue of Indigenous communities and the perception that colonisation is killing their respective cultures. Interestingly some have noted they would rather their cultures die with them than live on without them behind a glass box, but this would rather be a shame should it become true, yet perhaps this is simply due to your stance as a student of history.
