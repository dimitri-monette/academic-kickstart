title: Devlog 8 - Interstitial Spaces: Social Media As A Tool For Community Engagement
---
Clevlanders is a subject that struck me very intently and with much interest. A consistent element of thisc course has been the observation that the museums of the modern era have not progressed with their own times very well, and as such have remained largely stagnant in the way of online accessibility as well as lacking in the shift to more direct interaction a modern patron craves.

Here, this project has interestingly had a direct impact in reversing many of these pitfalls of museum work, noting in their own words "Clevelanders allows patrons to feel that they are direct contributors". This is something I would consider paramount in a modern social media and internet based society of interaction at all levels (even those as small as liking an image or giving it a thumbs up).

Any and all interaction is good interaction for the modern pervayor of archives and museums, something Clevlanders is successful with.

Even though as according to the writing itself "the cumulative social sphere of Clevelanders did not totally materialize" the interaction and success they were seeking still did materialze through the smaller individual basis interaction that went on around the project, lending one to believe it was atleast in some respects a success.

Overall, projects like these are inspiring pieces worth further exploration in the never ending chase to keep our historical places relavent and in pace with the development of time.
