title: Devlog 5 - Troubleshooting API's
---
Today I had the pleasure of coming to grips with the complexities of API work, or rather, the over complication one can face when every conceivable error appears while working with anything online based.

While the tutorial provided on API work was splendid and well put together, incompatibility in versions between browsers and operating systems resulted in numerous issues while working from start to finish on the project, ranging from EXCEL editing of the dividers within the initial dataset all the way to the individual launching of the final python work.

Ultimately, through trial and error, as well as some mild personal exploration we were capable of rooting out the base cause of many of the issues, resulting in a successful launch of the code onto not only Glitch but also within the personal coding base within python. 

Through our use of Anaconda the depths of coding became a little easier to understand, and as such the base layers and foundations have largely been set for the final construction of the final API for use with the Museum of History dataset collected for our larger groups. All in all, today was a large success, and one that saw significant advancements in understanding of topic material enablers.
