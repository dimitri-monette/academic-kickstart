title: Devlog 9 - Museum of Nature website
---
Unfortunately I was unable to attend the trip to the museum of nature with the class, so in post I have made the decision to look through the online footprint left by the nature museum in relation to its prescence physically.

When one thinks of technological modernity and digital footprint, one doesn ot think of nature in tandem with it. As such, one does not naturally associate the digital space with Nature museums at all.Through evaluating the site, one can see an odd mix of how the Nature museum is making an attempt at modernization through digitization, and yet remains locked in less than ideal builds of that goal.

Looking to the digital repository of information available to teh viewer upon teh site, base overviews are available for all to see and gain access to, yet individual entries and coverage are sparce or severly lacking in many regards. In this way, the digital realm of the museum is heavily lacking in comparison to its other museum counterparts. While it provides interactivity through colouring pages, it does very little else, largely rending that aspect of modernization and digitization lacking in the extreme. 

Overall, teh nature museums site is something the groups should invest heavier upon, as in its current state it is lacking when evaluated against its peers in terms of data delivery and marketability.
