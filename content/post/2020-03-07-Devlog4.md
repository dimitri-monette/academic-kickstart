title: Devlog 4 - Discovering API's
---
Datasette and other practical matters Was the topic of the day for the seminar class of March 02 2020. Api's appear a perplexing and yet simple beast, an item designed to simplify the editing, adjusting and exportation of data for not only the initial owner and creator these databanks, but also those looking to profit from their publishing. Api work as explained through Proffessor Graham is extremely lacking in large scale use and funding, due to numerous outlets explored in class including a lack of funds for institutions, a need to secure ones works and resources, and stubborn minded resistance to advancement. Ultimately, API work seems a valuable tool in data usage and a good protective layer for one publishing their works or their collections online, and one that will be of great use for our final assignemnts and potential future publishing not only personally but more at large.
