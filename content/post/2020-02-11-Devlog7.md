title: Devlog 7 - Measuring Engagement & Analytics. My Personal Thoughts
---
Measuring Engagement & Analytics, where to begin. Overall this weeks works were rather a mixed bag of reading, as while our first paper presented did an excellent job of exploring new conepts to the standard histroy major such as card sorts and Information Architecture, overall the reading was rather flat, lending no hand to the topic material being conveyed. Past this, our second reading had a more personal touch upon its writing style, however I found it pertained a little less directly to new concepts a modern historian might grasp out of the digital realm museums find themselves moving towards in comparrison to the first piece.

What struck me was the almost science like methodology that the study was conducted with regards to the museum and news web domains IA's, akin very much to almost a lab report format.

This is something relatively seen little of within academic historic circles, and while this type of writing and metod does little to inspire animation and attachment, it does present a clear an concise way that online management and modernisation as well as optimization can lead to better understanding of museum content and learning, as well as potentially drawing in far more visitors and interest.

These are concepts any modern worker in the history field should take extremely seriously, and something that should be brought to comfort with and familiarity for the ensured expansion and relevancy of modern collections and museums.
